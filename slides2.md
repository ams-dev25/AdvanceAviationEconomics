# Advanced Aviation Economics - Updated Slide Outlines (Weeks 6-10)

## Week 6: Determinants of Airline Costs

### Session 1: Operational Factors (Slides 1-10)

**Slide 1: Stage Length Economics**

- Data: Karachi-Lahore 1,000km @ PKR 15/km vs Karachi-Toronto 11,000km @ PKR 6/km
- IATA 2024: 40% unit cost advantage for long-haul operators
- Visual: Cost curve declining with distance

**Slide 2: The Stage Length Sweet Spot**
- Ultra-short (<300km) inefficiency: ground time = flight time
- Ultra-long (>12hr) cost spikes: crew rest, complex logistics
- Optimal ranges: 800-1,500km domestic, 4,000-8,000km international (Boeing 2024)
- Visual: Bell curve efficiency peak

**Slide 3: Aircraft Size Impact**
- Economies of scale: A320 (180 seats) $0.06 CASK vs 777 (350 seats) $0.045 CASK
- Breakeven loads: A320 needs 120 pax, 777 needs 250+ pax
- PIA 2023 case: 777s @ 65% load lose $15K/flight, A320s @ 75% profitable

- Forecasting application: short-term demand prediction, pricing adjustments
- Load factor projection: track against historical curves
- Visual: Booking curve by segment

**Slide 17: External Factor Integration**
- Fuel prices: 10% increase typically reduces traffic 2-3% (through fare increases)
- Exchange rates: rupee depreciation increases international costs (PKR-dollar parity critical)
- Infrastructure: new airport openings (Gwadar, new Islamabad impact), runway expansions
- Regulatory: open skies agreements, bilateral expansions change competitive landscape
- Visual: External factors impact matrix

**Slide 18: Forecast Validation Process**
- Backtesting: apply model to historical period, compare forecast vs actual
- Error metrics: MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
