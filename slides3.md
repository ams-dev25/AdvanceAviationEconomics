# Advanced Aviation Economics - Updated Slide Outlines (Weeks 11-15)

## Week 11: Aviation Regression Analysis & Game Theory

### Session 1: Regression Analysis in Aviation (Slides 1-10)

**Slide 1: Introduction to Aviation Regression**
- Definition: statistical method determining relationships between dependent variable (traffic, revenue) and independent variables (GDP, fares, etc.)
- Aviation applications: demand forecasting, pricing optimization, cost analysis, route profitability
- Why useful: quantifies relationships, tests hypotheses, predicts outcomes with confidence intervals
- Pakistan context: analyzing PIA cost drivers, domestic traffic determinants, fare elasticity estimation
- Visual: Basic regression concept diagram with aviation variables

**Slide 2: Simple Linear Regression**
- Formula: Y = a + bX + ε (Y=traffic, X=GDP, a=intercept, b=slope, ε=error)
- Example: Pakistan domestic traffic = 2.5M + 1.8(GDP growth rate)
- Interpretation: 1% GDP growth → 1.8% traffic increase (elasticity)
- R-squared metric: 0.85 means 85% traffic variation explained by GDP
- Visual: Scatter plot with regression line, Pakistan traffic-GDP data

**Slide 3: Multiple Regression Models**
- Formula: Y = a + b₁X₁ + b₂X₂ + b₃X₃ + ε (multiple independent variables)
- Aviation example: Traffic = f(GDP, Fare, Frequency, Competition, Exchange Rate)
- Pakistan model: Karachi-Lahore traffic function of income, airfare, PIA frequency, Airblue capacity, fuel prices
- Advantage: captures complex reality with multiple simultaneous factors
- Visual: Multi-variable model framework diagram

**Slide 4: Interpreting Regression Coefficients**
- Coefficient sign: positive (direct relationship), negative (inverse relationship)
- Coefficient magnitude: strength of relationship (larger = stronger impact)
- Statistical significance: p-value <0.05 indicates reliable relationship (not random)
- Example: Fare coefficient -0.8 means 10% fare increase → 8% traffic decrease
- Pakistan case: fuel price coefficient analysis for PIA costs
- Visual: Coefficient interpretation table with examples

**Slide 5: Goodness of Fit Measures**
- R-squared: proportion variance explained (0-1 scale, higher better)
- Adjusted R-squared: accounts for number of variables (more conservative)
- Standard error: average prediction error magnitude
- Aviation benchmarks: R² >0.7 good, 0.5-0.7 acceptable, <0.5 weak
- Pakistan challenge: volatile economy reduces model fit (R² typically 0.4-0.6)
- Visual: R-squared interpretation scale

**Slide 6: Elasticity Estimation**
- Price elasticity: % traffic change from 1% fare change
- Income elasticity: % traffic change from 1% income change
- Log-linear models: directly estimate elasticities (coefficients = elasticities)
- Pakistan estimates: domestic fare elasticity -1.3 (elastic), international -0.9 (less elastic)
- Business implications: pricing strategy, revenue optimization decisions
- Visual: Elasticity estimation results table

**Slide 7: Time Series Regression**
- Trend analysis: incorporating time variable (Year, Quarter, Month)
- Seasonal dummy variables: capturing Eid peaks, summer seasonality
- Lagged variables: previous period values predict current (traffic momentum)
- Pakistan application: PIA monthly traffic with Eid dummies, summer peaks
- Autocorrelation issue: observations not independent over time (requires correction)
- Visual: Time series regression with seasonal patterns

**Slide 8: Route Demand Modeling**
- Dependent variable: passenger traffic on specific route
- Independent variables: population, income, distance, frequency, fares, competition
- Gravity model integration: combining theoretical framework with regression
- Pakistan example: Faisalabad-Karachi demand model using city GDPs, distance, airline frequencies
- New route forecasting: apply coefficients from existing routes
- Visual: Route demand model specification

**Slide 9: Cost Function Estimation**
- Dependent variable: airline operating costs (total or per-ASK)
- Independent variables: fuel price, labor costs, stage length, aircraft size, load factor
- Returns to scale: do costs decrease proportionally with size increase?
- Pakistan case: PIA cost structure analysis identifying inefficiency sources
- Benchmarking: compare actual vs predicted costs (efficiency measurement)
- Visual: Cost function regression results

**Slide 10: Common Pitfalls & Limitations**
- Multicollinearity: independent variables correlated (e.g., GDP and population)
- Omitted variables: missing important factors biases results
- Structural breaks: relationships change over time (COVID-19 impact)
- Pakistan challenges: data quality issues, small sample sizes, high volatility
- Solution approaches: careful variable selection, robustness checks, scenario testing
- Visual: Regression pitfalls checklist

### Session 2: Game Theory Applications (Slides 11-20)

**Slide 11: Game Theory Fundamentals**
- Definition: mathematical framework analyzing strategic interactions between rational decision-makers
- Aviation relevance: pricing decisions, capacity deployment, route entry, airline alliances
- Key concepts: players (airlines), strategies (actions), payoffs (profits/losses)
- Nash equilibrium: stable outcome where no player gains by changing strategy alone
- Visual: Basic game theory structure diagram

**Slide 12: The Prisoner's Dilemma in Aviation**
- Classic scenario: two airlines deciding whether to compete on price or maintain high fares
- Payoff matrix: cooperate (both profit), defect (price war destroys value)
- Outcome: both compete despite lower profits (dominant strategy)
- Pakistan example: Karachi-Lahore route price wars 2018-2020 (all airlines lost money)
- Lesson: coordination difficult without communication, competition often destructive
- Visual: Prisoner's dilemma payoff matrix with aviation example

**Slide 13: Pricing Game Between Competitors**
- Two airlines on same route: PIA vs Airblue Karachi-Islamabad
- Strategy options: High Fare (PKR 15,000), Low Fare (PKR 10,000)
- Payoff scenarios: if both high (both profit PKR 2M), if both low (both profit PKR 500K)
- If one low/one high: low fare airline gets PKR 3M, high fare gets PKR 200K
- Nash equilibrium: both choose low fares (prisoner's dilemma)
- Visual: Pricing game payoff matrix

**Slide 14: Capacity Competition Game**
- Airlines decide aircraft deployment: Large (A320), Small (ATR-72)
- Considerations: market size, demand elasticity, competitor response
- Thin route example: if both deploy large aircraft → oversupply, losses
- Sequential game: first-mover advantage (commits capacity first)
- Pakistan case: Skardu route capacity decisions (seasonal tourism volatility)
- Visual: Capacity game decision tree

**Slide 15: Route Entry Decisions**
- Incumbent airline (PIA) vs Potential Entrant (SereneAir)
- Entrant decision: Enter or Stay Out
- Incumbent response: Accommodate (share market) or Fight (price war)
- Entry deterrence: incumbent pre-commits to large capacity (credible threat)
- Pakistan example: Fly Jinnah entry 2022 on major routes, PIA response strategies
- Visual: Route entry game tree with payoffs

**Slide 16: Repeated Games & Tacit Collusion**
- One-shot game: prisoner's dilemma leads to competition
- Repeated interactions: possibility of cooperation emerges (tit-for-tat strategies)
- Tacit collusion: airlines match prices without explicit agreement (legal gray area)
- Pakistan domestic: observed fare coordination on some routes (2015-2017 period)
- Antitrust concerns: CAA monitoring for anti-competitive behavior
- Visual: Repeated game timeline showing cooperation emergence

**Slide 17: Alliance Formation Game**
- Airlines decide: Join Alliance or Stay Independent
- Benefits: network effects, cost sharing, revenue synergies
- Costs: loss of autonomy, profit sharing requirements
- Strategic considerations: which alliance (Star, SkyTeam, oneworld), partner compatibility
- Pakistan reality: PIA not in major alliance post-2007 (missed opportunities)
- Visual: Alliance formation decision matrix

**Slide 18: Hub Competition Game**
- Gulf carriers (Emirates, Qatar, Etihad) compete for Pakistan-origin transfer traffic
- Strategy variables: frequencies, transit convenience, pricing, service quality
- Winner-take-most dynamic: network effects favor largest hubs
- Pakistan disadvantage: Karachi/Lahore lack critical mass competing with Dubai (90M+ passengers)
- Game outcome: Gulf hubs dominate, Pakistan carriers relegated to point-to-point
- Visual: Hub competition strategy space

**Slide 19: Subsidy Game with Government**
- Players: Government (provides subsidies), Airlines (invest/don't invest)
- Government strategy: Subsidize (taxpayer cost) or Don't Subsidize
- Airline strategy: Invest in network/service or Take subsidy without improvement
- Moral hazard: subsidy without conditions enables inefficiency
- Pakistan case: PIA subsidies 2015-2024 (PKR 500B+) with limited performance improvement
- Visual: Government-airline game payoff matrix

**Slide 20: Practical Applications & Limitations**
- Applications: competitive intelligence, strategic planning, negotiation preparation
- Limitations: assumes rationality (emotions matter), complete information (uncertainty exists), static analysis (dynamics complex)
- Pakistan context: political interference disrupts rational game predictions (PIA decisions often non-commercial)
- Best use: framework for thinking, not definitive predictions
- Recommendation: combine game theory with empirical analysis, scenario planning
- Visual: Game theory application framework

## Week 12: Pricing Policies & Air Freight Economics

### Session 1: Pricing Policies & Fare Structures (Slides 1-10)

**Slide 1: Airline Pricing Fundamentals**
- Objective: maximize total revenue from fixed capacity (perishable inventory)
- Challenge: heterogeneous passengers (different willingness-to-pay), uncertain demand
- Core strategy: price discrimination extracting consumer surplus from each segment
- Pakistan context: limited business segment constrains premium pricing potential
- Visual: Willingness-to-pay distribution curve

**Slide 2: First-Degree Price Discrimination**
- Concept: charge each passenger their exact willingness-to-pay (perfect discrimination)
- Reality: impossible in practice (information asymmetry)
- Closest approximation: dynamic pricing algorithms, personalized offers
- Auction models: name-your-price experiments (Priceline model)
- Pakistan adoption: minimal personalization (privacy concerns, data limitations)
- Visual: Perfect price discrimination diagram

**Slide 3: Second-Degree Price Discrimination**
- Concept: offer menu of quality/price combinations, passengers self-select
- Aviation application: fare classes with restrictions (refundability, change fees, advance purchase)
- Economy, Premium Economy, Business, First: vertical differentiation
- Restrictions screen passengers: business travelers pay more for flexibility
- Pakistan example: PIA Y-class PKR 35,000 (flexible) vs Q-class PKR 12,000 (restricted)
- Visual: Fare class menu with restrictions table

**Slide 4: Third-Degree Price Discrimination**
- Concept: segment market by observable characteristics, charge different prices
- Aviation segmentation: route (business vs leisure), time (peak vs off-peak), passenger type (student, senior)
- Pakistan practices: Hajj pricing regulated (special category), student discounts (limited)
- International: advance purchase requirements separate business from leisure effectively
- Legal considerations: discrimination must not violate protected categories
- Visual: Market segmentation pricing strategy

**Slide 5: Revenue Management Systems**
- Computer algorithms: optimize seat inventory allocation across fare classes
- Leg-based: manage each flight segment independently
- Network-based: consider connecting passengers, displacement costs (more sophisticated)
- Booking curves: track sales pace, adjust availability dynamically
- Pakistan adoption: PIA basic leg-based, private carriers improving (Airblue investing in RM 2023)
- Visual: RM system architecture diagram

**Slide 6: Fare Class Structure Design**
- Typical structure: 15-20 booking classes (Y, B, M, H, Q, V, etc.)
- Each class: different price, restrictions, availability
- Nested inventory: lower classes access unsold higher-class seats
- Restriction design: Saturday-night stay, advance purchase, change fees separate segments
- Pakistan challenge: limited business segment reduces fare spread (premium classes often empty)
- Visual: Nested fare class hierarchy

**Slide 7: Dynamic Pricing in Practice**
- Price changes continuously: demand forecasts, competitor monitoring, inventory levels, time to departure
- Algorithms process: millions of scenarios finding optimal price points
- Example progression: Karachi-Dubai 90 days out PKR 18,000 → 30 days PKR 22,000 → 7 days PKR 35,000
- Low-fare buckets: released tactically stimulating demand during slow periods
- Pakistan reality: less sophisticated than global leaders (Emirates, Qatar advanced RM)
- Visual: Dynamic pricing timeline visualization

**Slide 8: Competitive Pricing Strategies**
- Price leadership: dominant carrier sets fares, others follow (reduces competition)
- Price matching: automatically match competitor fares (technology-enabled)
- Penetration pricing: enter with low fares, build share, raise later
- Premium pricing: position as quality leader, charge more (Emirates, Singapore models)
- Pakistan competitive dynamics: Karachi-Lahore race-to-bottom 2018-2020, all carriers lost money
- Visual: Competitive pricing strategy matrix

**Slide 9: Ancillary Revenue Pricing**
- Beyond tickets: baggage, seat selection, meals, priority boarding, lounge access
- Unbundling strategy: basic fare low, optional services priced separately
- Global trend: LCCs 30-50% revenue from ancillaries, FSCs 15-20%
- Pakistan opportunity: current 5-10% ancillary revenue, massive growth potential
- Pricing psychology: baggage PKR 2,500 seems cheap after PKR 15,000 ticket purchase
- Visual: Ancillary revenue breakdown by category

**Slide 10: Regulatory Constraints on Pricing**
- Consumer protection: transparency requirements (all-in pricing), refund rights
- Antitrust: no predatory pricing (below cost to drive out competitors)
- Pakistan CAA regulations: fare filing requirements (limited enforcement)
- International: IATA fare construction rules, bilateral agreement constraints
- Subsidy routes: government-mandated fares (thin routes social service obligation)
- Visual: Regulatory pricing framework

- E-commerce growth: Amazon, Alibaba drive express cargo boom globally
- Visual: Air cargo demand drivers mind map

**Slide 14: Freight Pricing Mechanisms**
- Pricing basis: weight (per kg) or volume (per cubic meter), whichever yields higher revenue
- Volumetric weight: Length × Width × Height / 6000 (penalizes bulky, light cargo)
- Rate structures: general cargo, specific commodity rates (dangerous goods premium)
- Pakistan example: Karachi-London general rate PKR 400/kg, perishables PKR 600/kg
- Fuel surcharges: significant component (20-40% total price) tracking oil prices
- Visual: Air freight pricing calculation example

**Slide 15: Belly Cargo Economics**
- Incremental revenue: marginal cost low (fuel for weight), high contribution margin
- Capacity constraint: limited by passenger belly space (cargo competes for volume)
- Wide-body advantage: 777, 787 substantial cargo capacity (15-20 tons)
- Pakistan international: PIA wide-bodies generate PKR 5-10M cargo revenue per flight
- Optimization: balance passenger baggage vs commercial cargo (yield management)
- Visual: Aircraft belly cargo capacity comparison

**Slide 16: Freighter Aircraft Economics**
- Dedicated freighters: 747-8F, 777F, 767F, A330F (no passenger infrastructure)
- Operating costs: lower crew, maintenance focus, airport charges different
- Breakeven: requires sufficient density (unlike passengers, cargo no impulse demand)
- Pakistan gap: no dedicated freighter operations by local carriers (missed opportunity)
- Leasing: FedEx, DHL models (dedicated fleet), integrators dominate express
- Visual: Freighter aircraft types and capacities

**Slide 17: Cargo Hub Models**
- Integrator hubs: FedEx Memphis, UPS Louisville, DHL Leipzig (sort overnight, distribute)
- Traditional hubs: Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore (transfer between passenger flights)
- Hub requirements: central location, 24-hour operations, efficient customs clearance
- Pakistan potential: Karachi geographic advantage (Asia-Middle East-Africa), but infrastructure weak
- Competitive disadvantage: Dubai cargo 3M tons (2023), Pakistan 500K tons total
- Visual: Global cargo hub network map

**Slide 18: Express vs Deferred Cargo**
- Express: guaranteed delivery (24-48 hours), premium pricing, integrator-dominated
- Deferred: economy service (3-7 days), lower pricing, traditional carriers
- Market segmentation: express 40% revenue (20% volume), deferred 60% revenue (80% volume)
- Pakistan market: minimal domestic express, international DHL/FedEx/UPS dominate
- Local opportunity: e-commerce growth needs domestic express network (Daraz, others)
- Visual: Express vs deferred market comparison
