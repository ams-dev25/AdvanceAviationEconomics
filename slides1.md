- Barriers to entry: capital requirements ($500M+ minimum), slots, bilateral rights, brand
- Contestable markets theory: potential competition disciplines incumbents even without entry
- Pakistan domestic: concentrated (PIA 40%, Airblue 30%, SereneAir 20%, Fly Jinnah 10% shares 2024)
- International: dominated by Gulf hubs (Emirates, Qatar, Etihad capture Pakistan traffic)
- Visual: Market concentration analysis chart
---
**Slide 5: Demand Characteristics**
- Derived demand: aviation facilitates other activities (business, tourism, trade), not end itself
- Income elastic: air travel luxury good, grows faster than GDP (1.5-2.0 elasticity)
- Price elastic: leisure highly sensitive (-1.2 to -1.5), business less (-0.6 to -0.8)
- Seasonal patterns: peaks (summer, holidays, Hajj), troughs (Jan-Mar, Sept-Oct)
- Pakistan specifics: VFR dominates (60-70%), business small (15-20%), leisure growing (15-20%)
- Visual: Demand elasticity curves and seasonal patterns
---
**Slide 6: Supply Side Economics**
- Fleet decisions: aircraft type, capacity, ownership vs lease (long lead times 5-10 years)
- Network design: hub-and-spoke vs point-to-point, frequency vs size trade-offs
- Capacity discipline: supply-demand balance critical (excess capacity destroys yields)
- Pakistan supply: total fleet ~80 aircraft (PIA 19, Airblue 15, SereneAir 7, Fly Jinnah 3, others)
- Utilization rates: LCC target 11-12 hours/day, FSC 8-9 hours, PIA achieves 6-7 hours
- Visual: Fleet composition and utilization comparison

- Gulf hub dominance: Dubai 90M+ passengers (2023), captures Pakistan transfer traffic
- Network density: route frequency more valuable than destinations (business traveler preference)
- Visual: Network strategy diagrams with traffic flows
---
**Slide 13: Fleet Management Trends**
- Ownership vs leasing: shift toward leasing (70% global fleet, flexibility advantages)
- Operating lease: short-term (3-7 years), returns aircraft, no residual risk
- Finance lease: long-term (10-15 years), purchase option, residual exposure
- Pakistan leasing: PIA mixed ownership/lease, private carriers mostly lease
- Fleet commonality: single aircraft family reduces costs 15-20% (maintenance, training, spares)

## Week 2: Economic Regulation of International Air Transportation

### Session 1: International Aviation Regime (Slides 1-10)
---
**Slide 1: Chicago Convention 1944**
- Foundation: established sovereignty of airspace, framework for international aviation
- Key principles: (1) complete sovereignty over national airspace, (2) freedom of innocent passage
- ICAO creation: specialized UN agency, sets standards, coordinates regulation
- 193 member states: Pakistan ratified 1947, participates in ICAO assembly
- Enduring relevance: 80-year-old framework still governs international aviation today
- Visual: Chicago Convention timeline and principles
---
**Slide 2: Five Freedoms of the Air**
- First Freedom: overflight rights (transit without landing)
- Second Freedom: technical stops (refuel, maintenance, no passenger exchange)
- Third Freedom: carry passengers from home country to foreign country
- Fourth Freedom: carry passengers from foreign country to home country
- Fifth Freedom: carry between two foreign countries via home country
- Example: PIA Karachi-Toronto via Manchester (5th freedom UK-Canada)
- Visual: Freedoms of the air diagram with aircraft routes
---
**Slide 3: Additional Freedoms (6-9)**
- Sixth Freedom: carry via home country between two foreign countries (Gulf hubs exploit)
- Seventh Freedom: operate between two foreign countries without home country stop
- Eighth Freedom (Cabotage): domestic operations in foreign country (rare)
- Ninth Freedom: domestic operations by foreign carrier (virtually never granted)
- Strategic implications: freedoms determine network possibilities, competitive advantages
- Pakistan position: conservative on 7th/8th/9th (protects PIA), grants 6th to Gulf carriers
- Visual: Advanced freedoms examples with routes
---
**Slide 4: Bilateral Air Services Agreements**
- Country-to-country negotiations: determine routes, frequencies, capacities, airlines
- Key elements: designated carriers, traffic rights, capacity provisions, pricing, safety
- Pakistan ASAs: 100+ bilateral agreements, restrictive on most routes
- Liberal examples: Pakistan-UAE (unlimited capacity), Pakistan-UK (unrestricted)
- Restrictive examples: Pakistan-USA (limited frequencies, carriers designated)
- Renegotiation: periodic reviews adjust rights (Pakistan-Turkey expanded 2023)
- Visual: Bilateral agreement framework structure
---
**Slide 5: Traffic Rights Distribution**
- Route designation: specific city pairs or beyond rights
- Capacity clauses: specified seats/week or unlimited (liberal vs restrictive)
- Airline designation: single vs multiple carrier rights
- Pakistan patterns: Gulf routes liberal (UAE, Qatar, Saudi), others restricted
- PIA monopoly legacy: many bilaterals protect PIA (limits competition, higher fares)
- Private carrier challenges: difficult obtaining international rights (CAA/govt bottleneck)
- Visual: Pakistan bilateral agreements map with restriction levels
---
**Slide 6: Sovereignty vs Liberalization Tension**
- National interest: protect flag carrier, jobs, strategic connectivity
- Consumer interest: competition lowers fares, improves service, increases choice
- Economic argument: liberalization generates net welfare gains (empirical evidence)
- Political reality: flag carrier lobbying, national pride, employment protection
- Pakistan dilemma: PIA protection costs consumers billions annually (higher fares, poor service)
- Policy question: should Pakistan prioritize PIA survival or consumer welfare?
- Visual: Sovereignty-liberalization trade-off diagram
---
**Slide 7: Economic Regulation Framework**
- Tariff approval: historically governments approved fares (IATA coordination)
- Modern trend: tariff filing only, market determines prices (double disapproval principle)
- Capacity regulation: Bermuda I (predetermined), Bermuda II (flexible)
- Pakistan approach: tariff filing with CAA, limited review, market pricing domestic
- Charter regulations: separate permits, different rules, seasonal allocations
- Visual: Economic regulation evolution timeline
---
**Slide 8: Slot Allocation Systems**
- Definition: permission to operate at specific time at capacity-constrained airport
- Grandfather rights: incumbents retain slots (80% usage rule), barriers to entry
- Slot trading: some markets allow buying/selling (London Heathrow, NYC)
- Pakistan airports: Karachi, Lahore slot-constrained peaks, IATA Level 2 (facilitated)
- New entrant disadvantage: established carriers control best times (competitive barrier)
- Reform debate: auction slots vs administrative allocation (efficiency vs equity)
- Visual: Slot allocation process flowchart
---
**Slide 9: Competition Policy in Aviation**
- Antitrust exemptions: airline alliances granted immunity (coordinate prices, capacity)
- Justification: consumer benefits (network, seamless travel) outweigh competition loss
- Merger review: authorities assess competitive impact (recent: JetBlue-Spirit blocked 2024)
- Pakistan competition: CCP (Competition Commission) oversight, but limited aviation cases
- State aid issues: PIA subsidies PKR 500B+ (2015-2024), distorts competition
- Future concern: Gulf carrier subsidies vs Pakistani private airlines (unlevel playing field)
- Visual: Competition policy framework in aviation
---
**Slide 10: International Organizations**
- ICAO: technical standards, air navigation, safety, environment (Chicago Convention)
- IATA: industry association, billing settlement, operational standards, advocacy
- Regional bodies: ECAC (Europe), ACAC (Africa), APAC (Asia-Pacific)
- Pakistan participation: ICAO council member 2019-2022, IATA member airlines
- WTO GATS: services liberalization (aviation excluded), future potential inclusion
- Bilateral vs multilateral: trend toward plurilateral agreements (EU model)
- Visual: International aviation organizations chart

### Session 2: Regulatory Economics & Market Access (Slides 11-20)
---
**Slide 11: Protectionism Economics**
- Rationale: infant industry protection, strategic industry, employment, national security
- Costs: higher fares (20-40% versus liberal markets), reduced connectivity, inefficiency
- Winner: protected airline (if profitable), workers (if jobs maintained)
- Losers: consumers (pay more), economy (reduced tourism, trade, investment)
- Pakistan case study: PIA protection costs consumers $1-2B annually (fare premium estimate)
- Evidence: liberalized markets show lower fares, higher traffic, improved service quality
- Visual: Protectionism cost-benefit analysis
---
**Slide 12: Open Skies Agreements**
- Definition: unlimited traffic rights, no capacity restrictions, pricing freedom, multiple carrier designation
- US leadership: 130+ Open Skies agreements (1992-present)
- EU-US Open Skies (2008): liberalized transatlantic, increased competition, lowered fares
- Pakistan position: no comprehensive Open Skies yet, case-by-case liberal bilaterals
- Benefits evidence: EU-US fares dropped 15-20%, traffic increased 25% (2008-2015)
- Criticism: benefits large carriers more (network advantages), smaller players struggle
- Visual: Open Skies global map with adoption dates
---
**Slide 13: EU Single Aviation Market**
- 1986-1997 liberalization: three packages dismantled national protections
- Single market creation: any EU airline operate any EU route, unlimited capacity, free pricing
- Results: LCC explosion (Ryanair, EasyJet), fares dropped 40-50%, traffic doubled
- Consolidation: cross-border mergers (Air France-KLM, Lufthansa Group, IAG)
- Pakistan lesson: regional liberalization creates massive consumer benefits, forces efficiency
- Challenges: flag carrier bankruptcies (Sabena, Swissair), social costs (job losses)
- Visual: EU liberalization impact timeline
---
**Slide 14: Cabotage Restrictions**
- Definition: domestic market reserved for national carriers (8th/9th freedom denial)
- Rationale: protect domestic airlines from foreign competition
- US Jones Act equivalent: aviation cabotage universal (even EU single market exceptions)
- Economic cost: reduces competition, maintains high domestic fares (especially thin routes)
- Pakistan domestic: PIA, Airblue, SereneAir, Fly Jinnah only (no foreign carrier operation)
- Liberalization potential: allowing Gulf carriers domestic would decimate local airlines (politically impossible)
- Visual: Cabotage restriction world map
---
**Slide 15: Foreign Ownership Restrictions**
- Typical limits: 49% foreign ownership, 25% voting rights (US stricter: 25% foreign)
- Rationale: maintain national control, sovereignty concerns, security
- Economic impact: limits capital availability, prevents global consolidation
- Pakistan rules: 49% foreign equity allowed, but political sensitivity prevents enforcement
- PIA privatization: foreign investor interest low given restrictions, debt, regulatory issues
- Liberalization debate: Australia lifted to 100% (Qantas foreign-owned), no issues
- Visual: Foreign ownership limits by country comparison
---
**Slide 16: Pricing Regulation Evolution**
- Historical: IATA rate-setting cartel (pre-1978), government approval required
- Deregulation: market pricing, filing only (double disapproval principle)
- Pakistan transition: controlled fares until 1990s, gradual liberalization domestic
- Current regime: airlines file tariffs with CAA, no approval needed, market sets prices
- International: bilateral agreements sometimes specify pricing consultation
- Consumer protection: transparency rules, ancillary fees disclosure, refund rights
- Visual: Pricing regulation timeline 1944-2024
---
**Slide 17: Safety Regulation Economics**
- ICAO Annexes: safety standards binding on member states (Chicago Convention)
- National oversight: CAAs enforce ICAO standards, issue certifications
- IASA program: FAA audits foreign countries, Category 1 vs 2 (market access impact)
- EASA Third Country: EU audits non-EU airlines, bans unsafe operators
- Pakistan 2020: EASA banned PIA (fake license scandal), resumed 2024 after remediation
- Economic cost: EU ban cost PIA $500M+ revenue (2020-2024 estimate)
- Visual: Aviation safety oversight framework
---
**Slide 18: Environmental Regulation Emerging**
- EU ETS (Emissions Trading System): charges per ton CO2 (intra-EU flights)
- CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting): ICAO global scheme, offsetting growth above 2019 baseline
- SAF mandates: EU requires 2% SAF by 2025, 63% by 2050 (ReFuelEU Aviation)
- Cost implications: carbon pricing adds 1-5% ticket cost, SAF premium 3-5× conventional fuel
- Pakistan exposure: minimal currently, but future international flights face costs
- Competitive impact: differentiates airlines (sustainability-conscious consumers), increases costs
- Visual: Aviation environmental regulations timeline
---
**Slide 19: Consumer Protection Regulation**
- EU261: compensation for delays (€250-600), cancellations, denied boarding (strong)
- US DOT: tarmac delay rules, refund rights, baggage liability (moderate)
- Pakistan CPA: Consumer Protection Act covers aviation, but weak enforcement
- Economic burden: airlines face compensation costs, operational inflexibility
- Benefit: consumer confidence, service quality incentive, accountability
- Pakistan gap: passengers little recourse, PIA notorious for poor service, no compensation
- Visual: Consumer rights comparison by jurisdiction
---
**Slide 20: Bilateral Negotiation Strategies**
- Reciprocity principle: equivalent rights exchanged (balanced agreements)
- Negotiating leverage: market size, alternative hubs, political relationships
- Pakistan disadvantages: small market (28M), Gulf hub alternatives, weak negotiating position
- Successful tactics: link aviation to trade deals, use sixth freedom strategically
- Case study: Pakistan-China CPEC (air services liberalization component, expanded flights)
- Future strategy: regional agreements (SAARC, ECO), move beyond bilateral paradigm
- Visual: Bilateral negotiation factors matrix

## Week 3: Deregulation & Its Economic Impact on Airline Industry

### Session 1: US Airline Deregulation 1978 (Slides 1-10)
---
**Slide 1: Pre-Deregulation Regime**
- CAB (Civil Aeronautics Board): controlled routes, fares, entry (1938-1978)
- Route awards: political process, protected incumbents, no competition
- Fare regulation: cost-plus formula, hearings, uniform pricing (no discounts)
- Results: limited competition, high fares ($200 NYC-LA 1977 = $1,000 in 2024 dollars)
- Inefficiency: airlines competed on service (meals, legroom), not price, excess costs
- Consumer harm: limited choices, inability to access lower fares, restricted travel
- Visual: Pre-deregulation regulatory framework diagram
---
**Slide 2: Push for Deregulation**
- Academic research: inefficiency documented (Douglas, Miller studies), competition would benefit consumers
- Political momentum: bipartisan support (Kennedy, Cannon), anti-government regulation sentiment
- CAB chairman Kahn: economist, championed reform, experimental pricing flexibility
- Industry split: new entrants favored (PSA), incumbents opposed (legacy carriers feared)
- Consumer advocates: Ralph Nader, lower fares would democratize flying
- Legislation: Airline Deregulation Act passed October 24, 1978
- Visual: Deregulation advocates and opponents
---
**Slide 3: Immediate Post-Deregulation Changes**
- Entry freedom: new airlines launched rapidly (People Express, New York Air, 50+ new entrants 1978-1985)
- Price competition: discount fares introduced, fare wars erupted, prices dropped 30-40%
- Route expansion: airlines entered profitable routes, hub development began
- Service innovation: frequent flyer programs (American 1981), advance purchase discounts
- Traffic surge: passenger numbers increased 50% (1978-1985), flying became accessible
- Visual: Post-deregulation market changes timeline
---
**Slide 4: Long-Term Structural Changes**
- Hub-and-spoke networks: replaced linear routes, increased efficiency, connectivity
- Airline consolidation: mergers created major carriers (Delta-Western, American-TWA, United-Continental)
- LCC emergence: Southwest model revolutionized industry, no-frills competition
- Legacy carrier adaptation: two-tier wage systems, fleet rationalization, network optimization
- Competitive dynamics: constant flux, bankruptcies common (Pan Am, Eastern, TWA failed)
- Visual: US airline industry evolution 1978-2024
---
**Slide 5: Fare and Service Impact**
- Average fares: decreased 40-50% real terms (1978-2024), adjusted for inflation
- Fare dispersion: wide range (business vs leisure, advance vs last-minute), price discrimination
- Service unbundling: checked bags charged, meals eliminated, seats cramped (cost reduction)
- Quality perception: consumer complaints increased, but accessibility improved massively
- Traffic growth: 250M passengers (1978) → 900M+ (2019), democratization achieved
- Visual: Fare trends and traffic growth 1978-2024
---
**Slide 6: Market Concentration Trends**
- Initial competition: 1978-1985 hundreds of carriers, competitive intensity
- Consolidation wave: 1985-2000 major mergers, bankruptcies, capacity discipline
- Modern oligopoly: Big 3 (American, Delta, United) control 70% US domestic market
- Hub dominance: carriers monopolize fortress hubs (Delta-Atlanta, United-Chicago)
- Contestability debate: does potential competition discipline pricing? Evidence mixed
- Antitrust concerns: DOT blocked JetBlue-Spirit 2024, concentration worries
- Visual: Market concentration evolution chart
---
**Slide 7: Labor Market Effects**
- Wage differentiation: legacy vs LCC pay gaps (legacy pilots $300K, LCC $150K)
- Two-tier systems: new hires lower pay scales, benefits reduced
- Union power decline: deregulation weakened unions (bankruptcies voided contracts)
- Employment growth: total jobs increased (more airlines, more flights), but wages stagnated
- Productivity gains: employees per passenger decreased 40% (automation, efficiency)
- Distributional impact: workers lost wage premium, consumers gained lower fares
- Visual: Aviation labor market indicators 1978-2024
---
**Slide 8: Financial Performance Volatility**
- Cyclical profits: boom-bust cycle intensified (2000-2001 recession, 9/11, 2008 crisis, COVID)
- Industry losses: cumulative net losses 1978-2024 despite profitability some years
- Bankruptcy frequency: 180+ US airline bankruptcies 1978-2024 (Chapter 11 restructuring)
- Causes: overcapacity, fuel spikes, demand shocks, rigid cost structures
- Pakistan parallel: PIA losses PKR 500B+ (2000-2024), chronic unprofitability
- Financial fragility: thin margins (3-5%), vulnerable to external shocks
- Visual: US airline profitability cycles 1978-2024
---
**Slide 9: Consumer Welfare Assessment**
- Winners: price-sensitive travelers (leisure, VFR), access expanded dramatically
- Losers: service-quality preferences (business), small community connectivity reduced
- Net effect: consumer surplus gains estimated $20B+ annually (GAO studies)
- Distributional: benefits concentrated leisure travelers, business travelers mixed
- Quality-adjusted: lower prices offset service quality decline for most consumers
- Overall verdict: deregulation massively successful by consumer welfare standard
- Visual: Consumer welfare analysis framework
---
**Slide 10: Lessons for Other Countries**
- Deregulation success: US experience validated competition benefits (emulated globally)
- Transition challenges: bankruptcies, labor disruption, consolidation inevitable
- Complementary reforms: safety regulation strengthened (FAA independent), consumer protection added
- Context matters: large domestic market enabled competition (Pakistan smaller, different dynamics)
- Pakistan relevance: domestic aviation partially deregulated 1990s, international constrained (bilaterals)
- Policy implication: liberalization benefits consumers, but manage transition carefully
- Visual: Deregulation lessons checklist

### Session 2: Global Deregulation Wave & Pakistan Context (Slides 11-20)
---
**Slide 11: International Deregulation Spread**
- European Union: 1986-1997 three-package liberalization, single aviation market created
- Australia-New Zealand: 1990s trans-Tasman liberalization, increased competition
- Latin America: Chile early liberalizer (1980s), gradual regional deregulation
- Asia: ASEAN Open Skies (selective), India domestic deregulation (1990s), Pakistan partial reform
- Africa: limited progress, many markets still regulated, flag carrier protection
- Varied outcomes: context-specific, but generally competition benefits consumers
- Visual: Global deregulation timeline world map
---
**Slide 12: Pakistan Domestic Deregulation**
- Pre-1990s: PIA monopoly, high fares, limited service, capacity constraints
- 1990s reforms: private carriers allowed (Aero Asia, Bhoja Air entered), CAA separated from PIA
- Market opening: competition increased, fares dropped 20-30%, service improved
- Airline failures: safety issues, financial weakness (Bhoja Air 2012 crash, suspended)
- Current market: 4 carriers (PIA, Airblue, SereneAir, Fly Jinnah), competitive pricing
- Remaining barriers: CAA certification slow, slot constraints, PIA subsidies distort competition
- Visual: Pakistan domestic aviation timeline 1990-2024
---
**Slide 13: International Constraints**
- Bilateral system persists: Pakistan 100+ bilateral agreements, varying liberalization levels
- PIA protection: many agreements restrict frequencies, capacity, or designate PIA only
- Private carrier challenges: obtaining international rights difficult (Airblue limited, SereneAir domestic-only 2024)
- Gulf competition: liberal Pakistan-UAE/Qatar agreements enable Gulf carriers dominate international
- Lost opportunities: restrictive bilaterals keep fares high, connectivity limited, consumers harmed
- Reform needed: allow multiple Pakistani carriers on international routes, liberalize capacity
- Visual: Pakistan bilateral agreements restrictiveness map
---
**Slide 14: PIA's Decline Post-Competition**
- Market share erosion: 100% domestic (pre-1990) → 40% (2024), international share dropping
- Financial collapse: accumulated debt PKR 600B+ (2024), annual losses PKR 50B+
- Service deterioration: poor OTP (65-70%), safety issues (fake licenses, EU ban), reputation damaged
- Causes: overstaffing (18,000 employees vs 7,000 needed), political interference, no commercial discipline
- Competitive disadvantage: higher costs, lower productivity, rigid operations vs private carriers
- Privatization plans: 2024 govt attempting sale, low interest given challenges
- Visual: PIA decline indicators 1990-2024
---
**Slide 15: LCC Model in Pakistan**
- Fly Jinnah entry (2022): aggressive pricing, point-to-point, unbundled service
- Early success: captured 10% domestic market year one, expanded to 15+ routes
- Competitive response: established carriers matched fares (race to bottom), yields dropped
- Profitability challenge: thin margins, fuel costs high, limited ancillary revenue currently
- Growth potential: Pakistan underserved by LCC (35% global share, <15% Pakistan)
- Market development: Gen Z travelers embrace LCC model, leisure traffic grows
- Visual: LCC growth trajectory Pakistan
---
**Slide 16: Small Community Impact**
- Pre-deregulation: PIA served thin routes (Turbat, Panjgur, Chitral) via cross-subsidy
- Post-competition: pressure to eliminate unprofitable routes, connectivity threatened
- Government response: PSO (Public Service Obligation) subsidies for thin routes
- Effectiveness: subsidies expensive, inefficient, often interrupted (budget constraints)
- Alternative models: Essential Air Service (US), competitive tender for subsidies
- Pakistan challenge: balancing commercial viability with social connectivity obligations
